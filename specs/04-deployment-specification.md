# Eco-Coder Deployment Specification

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Eco-Coder AI Agent to the AWS Singapore region (`ap-southeast-1`). The deployment will leverage the **AWS Bedrock AgentCore Runtime** for hosting the containerized agent, as defined in the `00-implementation-strategy.md`.

## 2. Deployment Target

- **AWS Region**: `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore)
- **Service**: AWS Bedrock AgentCore Runtime

## 3. Prerequisites

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage ECR repositories, IAM roles, and Bedrock AgentCore Runtime agents.
- Docker installed locally for building the container image.
- The `bedrock-agentcore-cli` installed and configured.
- A GitHub repository for the Eco-Coder agent source code.

## 4. Infrastructure and Services

| Service                             | Purpose                                       | Configuration                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon ECR**                      | Container Image Registry                      | A private repository named `eco-coder-agent` will be created in `ap-southeast-1`. |
| **AWS IAM**                         | Permissions and Access Control                | An execution role for the agent with permissions for Bedrock, CodeGuru, and CloudWatch. |
| **AWS Bedrock AgentCore Runtime**   | Agent Hosting Environment                     | Configured to run the agent from the ECR image.                               |
| **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** | Configuration Management                | To store application-level configurations and secrets.                        |
| **Amazon CloudWatch**               | Logging and Monitoring                        | To store logs from the agent and monitor its performance.                     |
| **GitHub Actions**                  | Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) | A workflow to build, test, and deploy the agent to the AgentCore Runtime.     |

## 5. Deployment Artifacts

- **Docker Image**: A container image containing the Strands SDK-based agent, its tools, and all dependencies.
- **`.bedrock_agentcore.yaml`**: A configuration file defining the agent's properties for the AgentCore Runtime.

## 6. Deployment Process

The deployment process will be automated via a GitHub Actions workflow. The high-level steps are as follows:

1.  **Build**: The Docker image is built from the `Dockerfile`.
2.  **Test**: Unit and integration tests are run against the agent code.
3.  **Push**: The Docker image is tagged and pushed to the Amazon ECR repository in `ap-southeast-1`.
4.  **Deploy**: The `bedrock-agentcore-cli` is used to deploy the new version of the agent to the Bedrock AgentCore Runtime.

### Manual Deployment Steps (for initial setup)

The following commands will be used for the initial deployment and configuration of the agent:

1.  **Configure the agent**:
    ```bash
    agentcore configure --agent-name eco-coder-agent \
      --image-uri <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/eco-coder-agent:latest \
      --execution-role-arn <your-agent-execution-role-arn> \
      --region ap-southeast-1
    ```

2.  **Launch the agent**:
    ```bash
    agentcore launch --agent-name eco-coder-agent --region ap-southeast-1
    ```

## 7. Configuration Management

- **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager and accessed by the agent's execution role.
- **Regional Carbon Intensity Data**: Stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
- **Agent-specific settings**: Managed within the `.bedrock_agentcore.yaml` file.

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

- **Logs**: All agent logs will be sent to a dedicated Amazon CloudWatch Log Group in `ap-southeast-1`.
- **Metrics**: Custom metrics for agent performance, tool execution, and error rates will be published to CloudWatch.
- **Tracing**: AWS X-Ray will be enabled for distributed tracing to analyze the agent's execution flow.

## 9. Rollback Strategy

In case of a deployment failure, the CI/CD pipeline will be configured to automatically roll back to the previously known stable version of the agent by deploying the corresponding Docker image tag from ECR.
